# Face Identification Algorithm Which I believe might be pretty neat

##### This is a small project in which I will be focusing on a certain set of steps to folloe while onward to build a face recognition system. I am 
##### in no way an expert in this and do not encourage anyone who is reading this to believe this code as it is. I am making this for sole purpose of 
##### learning Computer Vision. 

### Origin  

So this came to my mind when I was building a basic functional face recognition system, which would take my facial data as a form of training data to recognize/identify the person who is in the provided video feed/image. After some time of doing that I was stuck on a couple problems, 

##### What if the persons in the feed were too far away from the camera? 
or 
##### What if the light was not sufficiently bright in the video/image feed?

While I understand that most CCTV cameras do not have very great resolution and video quality, I still want to try this out to find out what could be a theoritical limit in appropriate conditions. 

To solve the above arising problems, I have tried to create some sort of algorithm that the code/model will follow in order to identify the persons.

### Basic/Elementary Idea in mind

What I have in mind is that the model should work on steps like segmentation, noise removal, contrast stretching, facial feature extraction, liveness detection to identify the face.

## Please Note

This is only being made as a learning project and nothing more than that. I do not know if something similar to this has already been created.
